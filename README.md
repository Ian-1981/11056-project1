# Reflection

I throughly enjoyed working with HTML again after many years. It was good to get into problem solving and tweaking the page to look right. There was a good learning curve for CSS which resulted in suprisingly good results.
I am relativley happy with the page I produced, however given time, i would likley rebuild it again from scratch. The code i have produced is not as neat and clean as i would have liked, mostly as a result of tweaking, chopping and changing as a result of the learning process.

## what worked
-Grid - I liked working with the grid elements, was a logical function to use, once understood

-learning CSS - this level of customisation is welcome from the basic HTML i have previously used.

Overall layout - i like the look and feel of the page design, however there is always room to improve here.

Responsiveness - i was satisfying to see the page act responsively, this is not something that was easily achievable when i first wrote HTML code.



## what i would improve
There are a few "placeholders" within the built webpage, this came down to a time issue. 
-calendar - would look at embedding a google calendar with functionality to add events dynamically. The calendar i have built is significanltly less than ideal, and would not make the final cut.
-code neatness - given the learning process, the code is not at neat as i would like. Building 1 element at a time means there is likley a lot of duplicate code or redundant code that i would be able to clean up if i re-wrote the page from scratch
-standardisation - 
-map page - I had plans to build a map page to direct people to points of interest around Canberra, but would need to start looking at js coding to make this happen. It will remain a nice to have.
-more work on images/logos - The images and logos from Canberra Modern require additional work to help them fit in the new website. I chose to focus on coding the HTML and CSS rather than spend significant time editing these images. Again, in a proferssional context i would allocate additional resources to this task.
-Footer - Im not at all happy with the footer, i think it is too complicated for the page, but i wanted to have a go at a few functional elements, like the email subscribe function. If i was to start again, i would build a footer with company details and socail links only.


## Lo-fi prototype
This gave me a good sense of what i wanted to achieve, it then became a process of learning how to make it work in code.
