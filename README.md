# Reflection

I throughly enjoyed working with HTML again after many years. It was good to get back into problem solving through coding and tweaking the page to look right. There was a fun learning curve for CSS which resulted in suprisingly good results, despite having never used CSS previously.
I am relativley happy with the page I produced, however given time I would likley rebuild it again from scratch and significantly improve various areas. The code I have produced is not as neat and clean as I would have liked, mostly as a result of tweaking, chopping and changing as a result of the learning process. There are a lot of elements that though they function, could probably be streamlined or neatened up in the coding.

## What Worked Well
Completing this work was a great way of learning (and re-learning) HTML and CSS. 
-Grid - I liked working with the grid elements, was a logical function to use, once understood
-learning CSS - this level of customisation is welcome from the basic HTML i have previously used.
-Overall layout - i like the look and feel of the page design, however there is always room to improve here.
-Responsiveness - i was satisfying to see the page act responsively, this is not something that was easily achievable when i first wrote HTML code.

## What I Would Improve
There are quite a few areas i would like to invest more time in across the site. As my knowledge and experience in HTML5 and CSS increases, there would probably be areas that would benefit from re-coding in a more efficient manner. Some specific points: 
 
-Calendar - would look at embedding a google calendar with functionality to add events dynamically. The calendar i have built is significanltly less than ideal, and would not make the final cut.
-code neatness - given the learning process, the code is not at neat as i would like. Building 1 element at a time means there is likley a lot of duplicate code or redundant code that i would be able to clean up if i re-wrote the page from scratch
-standardisation - 
-map page - I had plans to build a map page to direct people to points of interest around Canberra, but would need to start looking at far more serious JS coding to make this happen. It will remain a nice to have for this body of work.
-more work on images/logos - The images and logos from the existing Canberra Modern website require additional work to help them fit in the style of the new website. I chose to focus on coding the HTML and CSS rather than spend significant time editing these images. Again, in a professional context I would allocate additional resources to this task.
-Footer - Im not at all happy with the footer, I think it is too complicated for the page, but I wanted to have a go at a few functional elements, like the email subscribe function and text decoration elements. If i was to start again, I would build a footer with company details and socail links only to keep it clean and neat.
-There are still a few "placeholders" within the built webpage, this came down to a time issue.

## Lo-fi prototype
This gave me a good sense of what i wanted to achieve, it then became a process of learning how to make it work in code.
Overall the lo-fi prototype gave me initial focus for the page, which i then modified and built on as my coding knowledge increased. This initial focus helped get started and lean some basic coding functions to make it work.
